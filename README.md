# This my first application with user interface (WPF) in C#
 It is very little application for HS Department where i work 2025.
 In work we have to print scans of every 200 people every day. 
 We have had a list of people and my colleges have to collect every scan documents by finding people folder in base. (every 200 people) 
 I decided to help and of course I wanted to make my job easier. 
 So , We have Windows and list of people.
 My programm take list of people (txt), then it will convert it to one big array object,
 each element of array = nameof folder (name match folder name in db). 
 User give 2 path of folders. Folders source and destination folder for collected pdf files.  
 App will be enter every folder in list one by one , and collect all pdf files in folder.
 before moving next folder , app will save result of combined pdf to destination folder.
 after that moving next folder.
I learn 1 month C# in Youtube and make it.
